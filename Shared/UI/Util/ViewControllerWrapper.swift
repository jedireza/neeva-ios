/// # Why do we need `ViewControllerWrapper`?
///
/// SwiftUI allows you to use `UIViewControllerRepresentable` to embed an arbitrary subclass of `UIViewController`
/// in a SwiftUI view hierarchy. However, this is suboptimal when used with a modifier like `sheet(isPresented:)` for a couple of reasons:
/// 1. SwiftUI will size the view controller to keep it inside the safe area, which we don’t actually want since the view controllers are
///   perfectly capable of handling that themselves. This also leaves blank space at the bottom of the screen, which looks bad.
/// 2. The presented view controller doesn’t know that it’s being modally presented. This means that some things won’t work properly,
///   such as swiping down to dismiss an `INUIEditVoiceShortcutViewController`.
///
/// To solve these problems, we use a little magic to directly present the view controller on top of the current `UIViewController`.

// this is used to obscure the current presentation status from other code
// since we don’t have a way to know whether the modal has been manually dismissed
